<h4>Other Things to Know:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Feel free to give them as many treats as you want!</li>
    <li>They are usually very sleepy in the morning, more active and excitable in the afternoon</li> 
    <li>Muttly might get excited and run "laps" around the apartment if you're eating or cooking</li>
    <li>When they play they make scary-sounding "gremlin" noises, it is not a cause for concern!</li>
     <li>Muttly is a thief with zero remorse. He can and will jump on the dining room table - the only truly safe surfaces in the living area are the island and countertops. If he does steal something, he's good about releasing it when you say "drop it" calmly but sternly, then reward with treats. </li>
    <li>Muttly on walks:
    <ul>
        <li>Muttly has a high prey drive and will try to lunge at pretty much everything - especially trucks, bicycles, and bigger dogs. The best way to troubleshoot for this is to do the “touch” command and reward, repeatedly, until the object has passed</li>
        <li>He is usually fine in the dog park but can definitely be an antagonist, so just stay aware of him seeming a little too interested in other dogs</li>
        <li>He LOVES the small dog park in front of the building (they will both drag you in there) because he wants to wait for runners and bikers to go by so that he can “chase” them like a psychopath, this is normal behavior</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
